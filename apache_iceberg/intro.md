### Welcome !

Unfortunately, Killercoda does not support object store buckets yet.  I would try another scenario.

You will have to deploy this in your own environment.  See https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/discussions/23427 for details.

If you want to see the profile of the queries (eg. see how much time it takes to execute the stages of the query), read https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/discussions/29735 for more info.
